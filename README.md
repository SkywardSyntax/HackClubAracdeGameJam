## Game Description

In this game, you control an ivory colored square that spawns in a desert background. The objective is to cross the desert to reach civilization, which is some distance in the upward direction relative to the Birds Eye view of the screen. However, there are many black circles that represent holes, and if you fall down one of them, you get taken backward 1 minute of your adventure and get placed there. If a point comes where you fall into a hole within 1 minute of your last reset, or your first "unreset" run, then you lose the game.

## Controls

- Use the arrow keys to move the ivory colored square in the desired direction.

## Objective

- The objective is to cross the desert to reach civilization, avoiding black circles that represent holes, which cause a reset if fallen into.

## Additional Information

- The game uses basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for rendering the player character, desert background, and holes.
- The game includes mechanics for crossing the desert, avoiding holes, and resetting the player's position upon falling into a hole.
